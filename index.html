            <h1>PLANNING STAT: A TOOL TO WRITE BETTER PERMITS</h1>
            <p>Amendments to the <em>Planning and Environment Regulations 2015</em> have changed the way permits are written. Here is a tool to help you write better permits.</p>
            
            <div class="info-text">
                <p>On 1 December 2024, amendments to the <em>Planning and Environment Regulations 2015</em> (<span class="highlight">the Regulations</span>) commenced. The amendments introduced new forms (4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12) and changed the way responsible authorities document decisions to grant or refuse permissions under planning schemes.</p>
                
                <p>The amended forms now include tables into which decision makers to specify the clause of the relevant permit requirement and matter for which a permit is required (<span class="highlight">the Permissions Table</span>).</p>
                
                <p>The logic of the changes are explained the recently re-written <a href="#" class="link">Writing Planning Permits</a> (May 2023) guide (<span class="highlight">the Guide</span>) issued by the DTP. The Guide, including the recent changes, were prepared by Equipe with Helen Gibson AM and Peter Allen PSM for DTP.</p>
                
                <p>Equipe have developed a tool to help you easily build a Permissions Table. We hope it helps.</p>
